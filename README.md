# Vulnerability Anti-Patterns

This repository presents the [Vulnerability Anti-Patterns](Vulnerability-Anti-Patterns.md) developed in the work "Cluster Crash: Learning from Recent Vulnerabilities in Communication Stacks" (published at ICISSP 20202) which we were not able to include in the paper (caused by page limitations). The Vulnerability Anti-Patterns follow the structure proposed by Naffees at al. in their work "Vulnerability anti-patterns: a timeless way to capture poor software practices (Vulnerabilities)" ([Ressource](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/ws/files/15143086/Nafees_VulnerabilityAnti_Patterns_Author_2017.pdf)).
